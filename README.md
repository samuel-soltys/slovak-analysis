# Slovak Demographics, Job Market, and Migration Analysis

This is a project done for team competition European Statistic Competition 2023, analyzing the demographics, job market, and migration trends in Slovakia from 2010 to 2021. The analysis includes data exploration, visualization, and modeling, aimed at gaining insights into the current state of these important socio-economic factors in Slovakia for each district as well as the whole country.

## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis was obtained from the Slovak Statistical Office, and it includes an Excel file with 11 sheets about the 2010-2021 period for every district in Slovakia. The sheets contain data on population, migration, job market (including average wage and employment rate), and education (including the number of schools in each district).

## Analysis and Visualization

The data was processed and analyzed using Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, and GeoPlot. Various statistical and machine learning techniques were applied to the data to gain insights and make predictions. The analysis results are presented in a 9-page presentation in the `ESC_BTCMASTERS.pdf` file.

## Repository Structure
